<description>Midwest Prototyping opened its doors early in 2001 with a single SLA 250 machine contained in the same office space as the founders desk. Jim Leonard had been exposed to rapid prototyping technology while earning a degree from MSOE (Milwaukee School of Engineering) several years earlier and could never shake his fascination with it.

Shortly after, satisfied customers began asking for additional services such as machining, fabrication, assembly and show quality finishing options. Larger part requests resulted in the addition of more SLA machines

By the end of 2006 the company moved into a new 18,000 square foot facility to enable future growth. This extra space growth across the business as new CNC machining and rapid prototyping equipment was installed shortly after the move. In 2008, the acquisition of longtime competitor Manitowoc Prototypes was completed and added even more capacity for the rapid prototyping division.</description>
